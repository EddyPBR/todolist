## Using the REST Client Extension in Visual Studio Code

If you're a developer working on this project, testing the API endpoints is crucial. To make this process seamless, we recommend using the REST Client extension in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

### Step 1: Install the REST Client Extension

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the left sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for "REST Client" in the search bar.
4. Click the "Install" button for the REST Client extension provided by Huachao Mao.
5. After installation, you'll need to reload or restart VSCode to activate the extension.

### Step 2: Testing Endpoints

In this project, we've provided a `routes.http` file in the root directory. This file contains a set of sample requests to test the API endpoints of our application.

To use the `routes.http` file:

1. Open the `routes.http` file in VSCode.
2. You'll see a list of HTTP requests
3. Click on the "Send Request" button next to each request to execute it.
